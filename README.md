# Features
## Finding Fruit Trees

![using the map to find fruit trees gif](/public/homepage.gif)
The 'Find Fruit Trees' page allows you to see all of the fruit trees managed by the NYC Parks Department, filtered by the fruit trees navigation on the left hand side. Clicking different types will load all of those trees into the Leaflet map.

## Bookmarking Trees

![how to bookmark a tree gif](/public/bookmarking.gif)
On the right hand side is a 'Bookmarked Trees' box where you can keep track of trees that you'd like to bookmark. When a tree icon is clicked on in the map, you have the option to bookmark it in the Leaflet popup. You can also remove bookmarked trees by clicking the 'remove' button.

## My Trees

![viewing personal bookmarked trees gif](/public/mytrees.gif)
The 'My Trees' page allows you to see all of your bookmarked trees in one place. With more time, I'd like to have the 'Bookmarked Trees' list show here as well, as well as some other options to create a route with the trees, and allow you to route your current location to a specific tree.

## About

This project was inspired by my own foraging experience growing up in NYC with an immigrant mother. She and I would go on walks and I learned so much about identifying plants, fruits, vegetables, and a general appreciation for food thanks to her. As a born-and-bred New Yorker, I often forget that this dense city is also its own forest and habitat, and paying attention to nature through foraging helps remind me of that connection to the land. I love seeing mulberries when they're in season as well as all kinds of other fruiting trees, persimmons, figs, etc. 

I hope you also enjoy perusing the fruit trees in your neighborhoods or routes, and this site helps you slow down to appreciate the ecosystem that is NYC/ Lenapehoking.
